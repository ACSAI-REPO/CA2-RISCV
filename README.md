Forked from : [dag7dev](https://github.com/dag7dev/risc-v-exercises-2020) repository.
# risc-v-pack-2020 ENGLISH:
This repo is a folder which contains many exercises regarding RISC-V.
I'm publishing them for archiving purpose and for your pure entertainment since there are not so many examples available about RISC-V (there are a lot of exercises on MIPS but not on RISC-V unfortunately).

Though I wrote every program in my native language and personally I don't mantain the sources, feel free to improve the code!

#### Requirements:
RARS, at the following address: https://github.com/TheThirdOne/rars/releases

#### NOTE:
I am going to add as soon as possible to this readme the list of the exercises with the translated name (since the filename includes the exercise in brief).
